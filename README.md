## Notes
- This application assumes the existence of a backend server providing endpoints for CRUD operations. Make sure to replace the placeholder URLs (http://192.168.211.221:9090/) with the actual URL of your backend server.
- Customize the UI, functionality, and server integration according to your specific requirements and preferences.
- Ensure proper error handling and validation for user inputs to enhance the reliability and security of the application.
